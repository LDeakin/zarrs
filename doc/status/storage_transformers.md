Zarr V3 does not currently define any storage transformers.

`zarrs` supports two internal storage transformers for debugging: [usage log] and [performance metrics].

[usage log]: crate::storage::storage_transformer::UsageLogStorageTransformer
[performance metrics]: crate::storage::storage_transformer::PerformanceMetricsStorageTransformer
