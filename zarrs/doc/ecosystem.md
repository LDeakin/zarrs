The Zarr specification is inherently unstable.
It is under active development and new extensions are continually being introduced.

The `zarrs` crate has been split into multiple crates to:
- allow external implementations of stores and extensions points to target a relatively stable API compatible with a range of `zarrs` versions,
- enable automatic backporting of metadata compatibility fixes and changes due to standardisation,
- stay up-to-date with unstable public dependencies (e.g. `opendal`, `object_store`, `icechunk`, etc) without impacting the release cycle of `zarrs`, and
- improve compilation times.

A hierarchical overview of these crates can be found in the [The `zarrs` Book].

#### Core
- [`zarrs`]: The core library for manipulating Zarr hierarchies.
- [`zarrs_metadata`]: Zarr metadata support (re-exported as `zarrs::metadata`).
- [`zarrs_metadata_ext`]: Zarr extensions metadata support (re-exported as `zarrs::metadata_ext`).
- [`zarrs_data_type`]: The data type extension API for `zarrs` (re-exported in `zarrs::array::data_type`).
- [`zarrs_storage`]: The storage API for `zarrs` (re-exported as `zarrs::storage`).
- [`zarrs_plugin`]: The plugin API for `zarrs` (re-exported as `zarrs::plugin`).
- [`zarrs_registry`]: The Zarr extension point registry for `zarrs` (re-exported as `zarrs::registry`).

#### Stores
- [`zarrs_filesystem`]: A filesystem store (re-exported as `zarrs::filesystem`).
- [`zarrs_object_store`]: [`object_store`] store support.
- [`zarrs_opendal`]: [`opendal`] store support.
- [`zarrs_http`]: A synchronous http store.
- [`zarrs_zip`]: A storage adapter for zip files.
- [`zarrs_icechunk`]: [`icechunk`] store support.
  - `git`-like version control for Zarr hierachies.
  - Read "virtual Zarr datacubes" of archival formats (e.g., [`netCDF4`](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), [`HDF5`](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/), etc.) created by [`VirtualiZarr`](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr) and backed by [`icechunk`].

#### Bindings
- [`zarrs-python`]: A high-performance codec pipeline for [`zarr-python`].
- [`zarrs_ffi`]: A subset of `zarrs` exposed as a C/C++ API.

#### Zarr Metadata Conventions
- [`ome_zarr_metadata`]: A library for OME-Zarr (previously OME-NGFF) metadata.

#### Tools
- [`zarrs_tools`]: Various tools for creating and manipulating Zarr V3 data with the `zarrs` rust crate
  - A reencoder that can change codecs, chunk shape, convert Zarr V2 to V3, etc.
  - Create an [OME-Zarr] hierarchy from a Zarr array.
  - Transform arrays: crop, rescale, downsample, gradient magnitude, gaussian, noise filtering, etc.

### Benchmarks
- [`zarr_benchmarks`]: Benchmarks of various Zarr V3 implementations: `zarrs`, `zarr-python`, `tensorstore`
