Experimental codecs are recommended for evaluation only and may have limited ecosystem compatibility.
By default, the `"name"` of of experimental codecs in array metadata links the codec documentation in this crate.
This is configurable with [`Config::experimental_codec_names_mut`](config::Config::experimental_codec_names_mut).

The experimental codecs with a &check; in the `V2` column below were developed with `zarr-python` 2.x.x compatibility.
They should also be compatible with `zarr-python` 3.x.x with `zarr_format=2` arrays.

Arrays created with `zarr-python` 3.x.x with codecs in the `numcodecs.zarr3` submodule are supported.
However, arrays must be written with `numcodecs` >0.14.1 which is unreleased at the time of writing.

By default, arrays encoded with `numcodecs.zarr3` codecs will fail to open because the `numcodecs.*` prefix for codec names is not supported by default.
This is intentional to encourage standardisation of some of these experimental codecs in the near future.
To enable support, the `numcodecs` codec names needs to be remapped to the identifier of the `zarrs` codec:
```rust,ignore
{
    let mut config = crate::config::global_config_mut();
    let experimental_codec_names = config.experimental_codec_names_mut();
    experimental_codec_names.insert("zfp".to_string(), "numcodecs.zfpy".to_string());
    experimental_codec_names.insert("pcodec".to_string(), "numcodecs.pcodec".to_string());
    experimental_codec_names.insert("bz2".to_string(), "numcodecs.bz2".to_string());
}
```
