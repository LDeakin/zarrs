Experimental codecs are recommended for evaluation only and may have limited ecosystem compatibility.
By default, the `"name"` of of experimental codecs in array metadata links the codec documentation in this crate.
This is configurable with [`Config::experimental_codec_names_mut`](config::Config::experimental_codec_names_mut).

The experimental codecs with a &check; in the `V2` column below were developed with `zarr-python` 2.x.x compatibility.
They should also be compatible with `zarr-python` 3.x.x with `zarr_format=2` arrays.

Arrays created with `zarr-python` 3.x.x with codecs in the `numcodecs.zarr3` submodule are not explicitly supported, but they may work.
Instead, the intention is to push forward with standardisation of some of these experimental codecs in the near future.
`numcodecs` codec names needs to be remapped to the identifier of the `zarrs` codec, for example:
```rust,ignore
zarrs::config::global_config_mut()
    .experimental_codec_names_mut()
    .entry("pcodec".to_string())
    .and_modify(|e| *e = "numcodecs.pcodec".to_string());
```
